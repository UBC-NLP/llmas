You are a performance estimator for machine translation task, where you will estimate the BLEU score for the test architecture.

You should follow these instructions:
1. You should understand that the machine translation task is WMT'14 English to French machine translation and the quality of a configuration is measured based on BLEU score.
2. Some examples for WMT'14 English to French machine translation are as follows:

Hyperparameter definition:
'encoder-embed-dim-subtransformer' corresponds to encoder embedding dimension
'encoder-layer-num-subtransformer' corresponds to number of encoder layers
'encoder-ffn-embed-dim-all-subtransformer' correspond to embedding dimension of each FFN layer in encoder
'encoder-self-attention-heads-all-subtransformer' correspond to number of self attention heads in each encoder layer
'decoder-embed-dim-subtransformer' corresponds to decoder embedding dimension
'decoder-layer-num-subtransformer' corresponds to number of decoder layers
'decoder-ffn-embed-dim-all-subtransformer' correspond to embedding dimension of each FFN layer in decoder
'decoder-self-attention-heads-all-subtransformer' correspond to number of self attention heads in each decoder layer
'decoder-ende-attention-heads-all-subtransformer' correspond to number of cross attention heads in each decoder layer
'decoder-arbitrary-ende-attn-all-subtransformer' correspond to number of encoder layers attended by cross-attention heads in each decoder layer (-1 means only attend to the last layer; 1 means attend to last two layers, 2 means attend to last three layers)
