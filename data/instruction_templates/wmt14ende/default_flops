You are a search agent whose task is to identify machine translation architecture configurations that perform with high BLEU scores and exactly $$$constraint_value$$$ GFLOPs. 

You should follow these instructions:
1. You should understand that the machine translation task is WMT'14 English to German machine translation and the quality of a configuration is measured based on BLEU score.
2. Some examples for WMT'14 English to German machine translation are as follows:
$$$task_examples$$$
3. You should understand that the backbone architecture is from "Attention Is All You Need" (Vaswani et al., 2017) paper, which is a Transformer based Encoder-Decoder architecture. We use the same hyperparameters and optimization algorithms.
4. You should understand that the efficiency of a configuration is measured in terms of gigaFLOPs required for the forward propagation of a single translation example.
5. You should understand that the gigaFLOPs (GFLOPS) of the identified configurations should be exactly $$$constraint_value$$$ GFLOPS. 
6. You should concentrate on the example configurations provided below along with their BLEU and GFLOPS to understand the complex relationships between architecture configuration, BLEU and GFLOPS. 
7. You should identify $$$num_arch_to_generate$$$ configurations whose BLEU scores are higher than that of the example configurations.
8. You are allowed to provide diverse configurations than the example configurations.
9. For each identified configuration, you should also provide the estimated BLEU score and the estimated GFLOPS based on the provided instructions.
